      **Activity-Level Subject References**

      Activities lack a formal way to reference subjects (commits, files, patches, PRs).
      The `subject` schema is only available at root level. Currently must use
      free-form `content` text to describe what an activity relates to.

      **Suggestion:** Add optional `references` field to activities as a named map
      of subjects, reusing the existing subject type infrastructure:

      ```yaml
      - id: some-resolution
        category: resolved
        references:
          fix:
            type: commit
            commit: "9bd77d8..."
          related_pr:
            type: patch
            provider: github-pr
            provider_ref: "456"
        content: |
          Fixed in [this commit][fix] by changing the version number.
          See [related_pr] for additional context.
        addresses: [original-issue]
      ```

      Reference names can be used in `content` via markdown reference-link syntax:
      - `[fix]` - renders as link to the referenced subject
      - `[display text][fix]` - renders display text as link to the subject

      This enables activities to formally reference multiple subjects by name
      (commits, files, patches, other PRs) in a structured, machine-readable way.
